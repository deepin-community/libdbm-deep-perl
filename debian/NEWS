libdbm-deep-perl (2.0000-1) unstable; urgency=low

  From upstream Changes:

  1.9999_01 Jun 27 14:22:00 2010 PDT
  - THIS VERSION CHANGES THE FILE FORMAT.
    - Databases from DBM::Deep 1.0003 and higher can still be opened.
    - Newly-created databases automatically use the version 2.x format
      (numbered 4 internally), which version 1.x cannot open.
    - The optimize method, since it copies everything to a new database,
      upgrades it.
    - There is a new db_version method.
